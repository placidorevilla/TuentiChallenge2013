Tuenti Challenge 2013
===================

Problem: Alien invasion
-----------------------

This is the source code used to generate the binaries for the "Alien Invasion" problem in the 2013 Tuenti Challenge (problem 20, the last one). You can use this to know how close you got to solving it.

When you logged in the challenge you were assigned one of eight different passwords to find (to avoid people sharing the solution) and you can generate yours by changing the generate.sh script.

You can generate the binaries by running generate.sh.

Enjoy!
